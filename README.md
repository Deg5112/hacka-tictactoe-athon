This was our first hackathon, modeled after tic tac toe.

I was paired up with 3 other team members, and we were all delegated different parts of the app to create. My contribution was figuring out a way to have an image, follow the mouse for a first person shooter type of feel, I also made the X and O animations when a user clicks on a duck, along with the audio that follows it. 

I also wrote the javascript function that handles the win condition. So everytime a user clicks on a duck, the function runs to check if player X or player O won the game or not.  This was another great experience where I got to work with a team, learn how to resolve merge conflicts. The most important lesson I learned was to get a working minimum viable product out the door as fast as possible, and worry about the design after the functionality works.
